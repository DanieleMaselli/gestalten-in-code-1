The current documentation shows the results of the course “gestalten in code” in the winter semester at the university of applied science in Potsdam, supervised by Fabian Morón Zirfas. The course provides an introduction of basic programming in P5.js and Processing with a focus on gestalt psychology and a workshop on physical computing.

The first project of the University seminar gestalten in code was titled 'analog algorithm'. 
The main task of the project was to provide a set of instructions in a human language emulating algorithms in machines. The instructions had to be in one sentence,simple to understand and could be composed with parameters or constants.

##Algorithm part 1.

####_“Draw round shapes in vertical and horizontal which differ from the diameter. Create lines that merge into different points”._ 
---

The seminar began with the task of carrying out the first line of algorithm, with the result of having found the first source of inspiration and work flow for the upcoming executed algorithm thanks to a creative classmate.

The choice was based on a design that has been especially helpful for the subsequent actions that influenced the comprehension for the upcoming executed algorithm.
 


##Algorithm part 2.

####_“Draw circles of various sizes throughout the sheet distant each other. Trace straight lines which intersect but do not touch the circles._ 

---

The second attempt for an analogue algorithm was more accurate on the description. Even it was explained very well, most of the people draw something out of my expectations. The purpose wasn't to create a text that scares the reader or make him think too much for concluding an action. For that reason it was really important to phrase the instruction clear to prevent any misunderstandings.

The choice of the material was free, which also included objects. The interesting thing about the output was set by the different visual tension giving from a circle and a line to create some sort of grid.

While looking on different drawings, it is recognizible that every person gives a different touch and express them self in different way by just using a circle and a line. The problems for creating my expectation for this work, was more on getting the people covering the whole paper.

##Algorithm part 3.

####_Draw twenty filled circles of different sizes._
####_Circles connect with a straight line._ 
####_Connections must cross at least once._

---

The third part of my algorithm was set by an amount of circle to draw and a rule for crossing each lines at least once. The material used was selected in advance to create a more controlled result. The performers had available a brush and ink on rough paper.

After getting all the results, by choosing some of my favorite drawings, it was immediatly recognizable that it has to be more controlled by the material on which it runs.

I choose one specific draw, which gave me the idea for creating more visual depth and a percentage of circles, instead of a defined number of circle.  



##Conclusion

![](./assets/images/algo-5.png)

####_Draw a circle consisting of 20 to 30 filled circles that do not touch each other._ 
####_Circles are reduced in proximity to the center._ 
####_Create a path with a continuous straight line that connects all circles, and each line crosses an existing line and once passes through the center of each circle._

---

The third and last algorithm was my final attempt. This time I took more control about the drawings, with different colors according to contrast and combination. The text was more accurate and understandable for the executor. I've got the results that I desired by setting an amount of possibilities in the algorithm, like a set of number and rule that gives the final output some space and depth by reducing the sizes of the circle near the center.

After all the drawings that I got from every person, I was inspired for making a composition with all the different results that I got from, so I used my second choice drawings to create a frame for my end results and to enhance the design.
